# What has Fourier got to do with optics?
The example of the rolling hills in the introduction of this chapter might suggest a different way to look at images, but it is still not straightforward why Fourier transforms are involved in optics and, ultimately, microscopy. Advanced optics books do not usually spend many words on it and directly dive into complex math, derivating formulas until a Fourier transform appears. On the other side of the spectrum, biology books never mention spatial frequencies and explain every phenomenon in terms of diffraction and interference, hiding many problems with this explanation under the carpet. The average biophysicist might get frustrated and confused with either treatment and wonder about the actual physical meaning. In this section we will try to approach this topic _gently_, but without taking any important step for granted.

Let us get back to the hill example. As we have mentioned in chapter 2,
