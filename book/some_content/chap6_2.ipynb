    "# The diffraction limit revisited\n",
    "\n",
    "We have previously learnt that diffraction is the reason behind the limits to the maximum resolution we can achieve (the smallest features measurable). Now that we start to have a better understanding of Fourier optics, we can revisit this concept in terms of spatial frequencies and finally understand why and how it applies to microscopy and bioimaging. The key concept in this section is that the collection area, for example of an objective, will always have a finite size: some information will be inevitably lost. This is equivalent to having an aperture of the same size blocking the rays far from the principal axis. For this reason we will first look at the Fourier transforms of two important types of apertures.\n",

When these partial waves reach the tube lens, in the back focal plane (image plane) we will measure the Fourier transform of a truncated plane wave. This is equivalent to measuring the diffraction pattern of a circular aperture having the same size as the objective lens, or in other words an Airy disk. \n",

    "With Fourier optics as a new tool at hand, it is interesting to compare quantitatively the criteria for the limits to resolution of an imaging system, starting with Abbe's criterion. We can derive it following his original reasoning: he knew about diffraction from gratings (a regular series of slits) and claimed that one can resolve the distance between the slits only if they are able to collect at least the zeroth and the first diffraction orders ({numref}`Fig. {number} <abbe>`). \n",
